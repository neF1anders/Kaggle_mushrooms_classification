This project was developed as a homework assignment for the "Neural Networks" course, focusing on the practical application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Project Overview
The primary goal was to build and train a CNN model to classify images of mushrooms into their respective genus categories. The project demonstrates a complete deep learning pipeline, from data handling to model training and evaluation.

Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated on the following dataset:

Mushrooms Classification (Common Genus) Images

Source: Kaggle

Technical Implementation

Frameworks & Libraries:

PyTorch for building, training, and evaluating the neural network.

PIL for image preprocessing and augmentation.

NumPy & Pandas for numerical operations and data manipulation.

Matplotlib for data visualization and plotting results.

Hardware & Environment:

Environment: Local machine.

Acceleration: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU.

Processing: Leveraged CUDA cores for significant speed-up in training.

Training & Results
The custom CNN architecture was trained for a total of 25 minutes on the local hardware setup.

The model achieved the following performance on the validation set:

Validation Accuracy: 86.89%

This result demonstrates the model's effective learning capability and its high potential for accurate mushroom genus classification.
