# Mushroom Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project was developed as a homework assignment for the "Neural Networks" course, focusing on the practical application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview
The goal was to build and train a CNN model for image classification of mushrooms into their respective genus categories, implementing a full deep learning pipeline.

## Dataset
Source: [Mushrooms Classification (Common Genus) Images from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images/data)

## Technical Stack
Language: [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Core Framework: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) & torchvision

Key Libraries: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 

## Training Results
Training Time: ~25 minutes

Validation Accuracy: 86.89%

The model demonstrates strong performance in classifying mushroom species, achieving high accuracy while maintaining efficient training times thanks to hardware acceleration.
